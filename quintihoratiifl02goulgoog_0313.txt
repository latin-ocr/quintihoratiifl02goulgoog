This satire, written by way of dialogue, is intended to show that
all mankind are either madmen orfools. Horace had retired in· -
to the country during the Saturnalia Damasippus, s stcic phi·
losopher‚ pays him ο visit and in conversation blame· him for not ²
writing and publishing something new, instead of remaining idle,
orretouching his former works. 'l'he discoursc‚ by an easy tran-
sition, turns upon Damasippus ancl his mode of life. This leads ‘
ιο an e lanation of the doctrines of the stains, and a justification
of their ogmss. The various passione, which tyrannice over the ·
hmnsn beart, are portrayed with immitable skill. The whole
conversation is interspersed with moral reflectione and usefal
instruction. ζ’·
