This satire oonsists os nn amusing dialogus between the poet J

nnd oue Cetius, who pretends to be s great philosopher, ond also
to bs profoundly wersed in the science of cookery. But he he7
eomes ridiculous hy attaching so much importunes to what is of
littleoonsoqueuce3 ond more particularly byuexposing his utter
ignorunce of the subject on which ho discourses. The whole is
a lreen ssiire upon thot oless of meu. who ploce their supreme
happiness in the plensures of the table. This he considers nn
nhuse of Epicurennism, in the refined forms os which he wes him-
selfe believer. ,
