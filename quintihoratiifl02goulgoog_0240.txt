ODE VII.

Licinius Varro Murena, the brother of Proculeius Varro Mure-
na, mentioned in Ode Il. 5. of this Book, for his parental affection
and generosity towards his brothers, was a young man osa restless,
ardent, and ambitious spirit Horace, knowing his character, and
wishing to preserve him from the evils to which his fearlcss and

¹ aspiririg views exposed him,'addressed this ode to him, contain-

ing much sound wisdom, and some excellent rules and maxims for
life. But Licinius could not be governed by thern. Having been
detected in forming a ‘conspiracy against Augustus hc suffered
the fatal consequenoes of his rashnese For all the interest which

Quinctius Hirpinus was a man of great werith, and of an anx·
inus and timid character. He made himself unhoppy by dreading
changes and civil commotions‚ which might ondanger his posses-
sions. Horace offers to him, in this beautiful ode, the same kind
of consolation which he frequently gives to others in trouble. He
exhorta them not to bc anxious about futurity3 since life is too

shortto have any portion of it trusted inunavailing anxieties. Old ⁵

age and infirmities will soon deprive them of the power of enjoy7

ingthe blessings they possess. He recommends, therefore, that ’“ ³

they should make the most of present enjoyments, without troub-
