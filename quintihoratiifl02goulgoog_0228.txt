ODE XXIII.
'l'he occasion os this ode is not known3 although it has been the

¹ subject of various conjectures. lt· is a dialogus, represented as
¹ having taken place between a manner and the shade of Archytas,

ι celebrated mathematician aad philosopher ol' Tarentum.
Archytas had been shipwrecked on the coast ol Apulia3 and
the poet represents a mariner, who had accidentally found his
body driven ashore bytho waves, as thus exclaiming: ‘And could
not you escape death, Archytas! How small a space you cover,

ἐ who could measure the heavens, the earth, and the seal’ The ad·

dress os the mariner occupies the first six verses, aad the reply

ἵ continues thrpugh the ode.

others think the meaning to be this: ‘the trifling favor of a little

’ to the prevailing belief that the so'ul could not pass the Styri
a hundred years, if the body were not buried To this, ref- Ι
aresce is made at the conclusion of the ode, where the mariner is
enta-ested to render this little service, osthrowing earth upon the
body, which was of so much consequence to the soul.
7. Occidit: 'rue shade ol Archytas here replies to this effect:
'‘Do nothe surprised, mariner, thatl have shared the common lot
os humanity3 for Tantum died, though he was admitted to the
society of the girgm aad Ihthbnus, Pythagoras,' &c Archytas
