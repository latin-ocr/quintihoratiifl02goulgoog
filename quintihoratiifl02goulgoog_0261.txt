rue Romans believed thet muuy of their gods pessed their sum- ξ

mers in one country, und their wintere in another. Faunus was ἶ

ofthis number. He wus supposed to come into ltuly on the l3th
of February, und to return to Arcadia on the 5th of December.
Both these duys were observed by ruorifiees end festivity in hon·
orof Faunus, who wus supposed topreside over their iiocks und
fields. This ode was probably written for one ofhis festivals.
In the first port, tbe poet entreats Faunus, il'he poye him due hon·
ors, to smile upon his fields, und preserve the tender offspring ol
his floolrs3 und in the second, he sets forth the joy ol‘ the village

on the return of his autumnul feast, when men und beust will re- i

lux from their teil, und rejoioe in the bounty of their benefactor.
